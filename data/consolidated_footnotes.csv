That caste is the cause of many of the evils of India, the Abbé Dubois declares to be a mistaken notion. Without caste, he believed the natives of Hindustan, would rapidly degenerate into a barbarous state : thus he held the Pariah who is without caste, as an example of how the want of it would act.

This is done to demon- strate from which god they considered they are deriving protection, or else to honour him, in hopes that he will dissipate some sickness, or avert the evil eye. The Hindu tabernacle, is properly speaking borne by priests, (although it is now mostly taken on wheels forming a car) whilst that of the Jews is directed to be carried by Levites : or should none such be present, by the highest in rank, amongst the members of the congregation.

Ten years later, the hieroglyphies on the cross, were tranlated by a Brahman, into a short history of the Saint and his Converts, with an account of his death, and the erection of the stone, by certain Kings in commemoration of him.

But it is nothing of the sort, it is the best test that could be adduced to the contrary, (admitting them to be pure Europeans, which they are not.) The pure White Jews have never been able to continue their race without the aid of immigrants from other places, and before this question was ever mooted, Governor Moen’s remarked, that the White Jews were continued, owing to constant admixture with new blood. So it is now, none of upwards of three generations, born in the country, of pure white blood on both father’s and mother’s side, can be detected.

(cotd.) extraordinary legends concerning this people are extant, and for the verifica- tion of many of them, the shade of Cheraman Permaul is invoked, even hundreds of years after he had paid the debt of nature, A.D. 378. For this event various authors have indulged in dates of their own, without advancing any argument whatever, tending to prove them correct; for instance. Moens, gives A. D. 426. Dr. C. Buchanan, 490. Bishop Middleton, 508. Mr. Lawson, 750. The Rev. T. Whitehouse, 825! Paoli, the tenth century ; and the Jews themselves, A. D. 379, making a trifling difference of 446 years, between the date given by them, and that by Mr. Whitehouse. It appcars that the origi- nal date, or rather that given on the copper plates by the translator, is one year subsequent to Cheraman Permaul's death, whereas the text of the grant, states it to have been made in the 36th year of his reign, or the year before his demise, viz., A. D. 377. If the translation is referred to, it will be seen that the grant was made in the 36th year of his reign, but written in A.D. 379. The Syrian plates are identical with those of the Jews, which has given rise to the idea, that both, or at all events one of them, must be spurious, but quite an opposite construction may be placed on this similarity. If they were both granted at the same time, and conferred the same privileges, it is but natural to suppose, that similar words aud expressions might be used, where the witnesses were the same, and the same Secretary drew up the grants.",2,415

But the bad faith of the Malabar princes, and the competition of European rivals, caus- ed them much disappointment.

The contracts mention no fixed rate, but only speak of the market rate, as the rule to be adhered to. The Dutch designated all trade with other parties contraband, and frequently brought Military force to check it, this was expensive, and the Malabar com- mand was almost invariably in debt.
