* Repelim is known as Eddapully or Ellengaloor, and is in the Cochin State.
* It is curious that it has been asserted, and still is repeated again and again in Europe, that these Black Jews are a distinct race, instead of Natives of the country, converted to the Jewish faith.
* This appears to have been an ancient symbol, of the gift, or transfer of property.
* History is silent respecting what became of the numerous Syriac books, the Dutch must have obtained at Cranganore; they do not ever appear to have been given to the world, and a long personal search, has proved their non-exist- ence amongst the Dutch records of Cochin.
† It seems that after the advent of the Dutch, many institutions such as the above, on being removed to more secure territory in the Native States, took the names of their original stations with them. Consequently it does not always follow, that Roman Catholic stations whic bear certain names at the present day, are the same places, which formerly in the time of the Portuguese bore those designations.
* Castes existed amongst the Egyptians, Medes, Persians, and others. Castes are maintained amongst some Roman Catholic congregations in Malabar to this day. (See page 231.) Caste distinctions were observed in the Tanjore and other Protestant missions, from the time of Schwartz and Gerické, it was only July 5th, 1833, that Bishop Wilson declared, that the Native Christians had not followed the advice given by his predecessors for its discontinuance, that "in short under the name of Christianity, half the evils of Paganism are retained," and, that it "must be abandoned, decidedly, immediately, finally." In Tanjore the reading of the circular, "was received by the Native Chris- "tians with great displeasure, and they showed their views, by seceding in a "body."—PERCIVAL, Land of the Vedas.
† In every place the above rank of castes does not hold good, thus a Nair who is a Sudra, would consider himself polluted, eating with an Oonce, who is an Amabalavassee, and wears the sacred thread. That caste is the cause of many of the evils of India, the Abbé Dubois declares to be a mistaken notion. Without caste, he believed the natives of Hindustan, would rapidly degenerate into a barbarous state : thus he held the Pariah who is without caste, as an example of how the want of it would act. The Abbé asserts, that a nation of Pariahs left to themselves, would speedily become worse than the hordes of Cannibals, that wander over the African deserts.
* See an account by Kookel keloo Nair in an interesting paper in the Madras Quarterly Journal of Literature and Science. Referring to this subject the writer observes that the Jains, or Bhuddists, "as a people, were settled in "Arabia, and many visited Malabar; the original name was Mahajain, and "became in time corrupted to Magains, or Magans. The Hindus through mis- "take call the Mussalmen also Bhuddists, and from this arose the idea, that "the last of the Permauls became a Mahomedan."

It is mentioned by Ptolemy, and may have existed at the commencement of our era. It was subdued and divided in the 10th century.
* The Ambassador became a Christian, and was knighted, by John III of Portugal, he was Christened "John of the Cross." On his return to Calicut, he was banished from the Court in disgrace, as a renegade from the religion of his fathers. In 1532 he joined the Parravars and at the head of a deputation of them came to Cochin, imploring the assistance of the Portuguese, against the Moors. All the embassage, (85 souls) turned Christians. A Portuguese fleet was sent to their relief when 20,000 of them immediately consented to be baptised; ten years subsequently, Xavier organized a church for them.
* It is very difficult to ascertain anything respecting the accuracy of these very early dates, even when they relate to European history. Thomas Cana certified that he saw the last of the Perumauls alive in the year 345, whilst on a reference to the Brahman College at Trichoor, an answer was received, which corroborates his statement asserting that Cheraman Permaul ascended the Musnud about March 24, A.D. 341, and reigned 36 years and four months: but the date of May 378, is then given as that, at which he was last seen: making the length of his reign 37 years and two months.

* Trevandrum, Government Almanac, 1861. Some Churches which have been incorrectly included, have been here expunged.
† The Churches have been divided in the following manner: The Roman Catholics, and the Romo-Syrians, are under two distinct Missions. The Romo-Syrians and the Latin Churches, were originally under the autho- rity of the Portuguese. The Archbishop of Cranganore, receiving his instruc- tions from Goa, and having under him the two subordinate Bishops of Cochin, who were removed in 1663 to Quilon, the Churches under the latter were con- sidered to be all within sight of the sea. In 1709, they wished to join the Syrians. The Romo-Syrians, or at all events some of them, obeyed the Carmelite Vicar Apostolic, or the Verapoly Mission, which receives orders from Rome. In 1773, they erected schools for the instruction of Romo-Syrian Priests, and began to encroach considerably on the Latin Churches, then acknowledging the authority of Goa. They Syrians are ostensibly under the patriarch of Antioch, and are Monophysites, or Jacobites, with some slight differences.
‡ Their return of Christians professing their faith, is about 228,000, but this is obviously erroneous. Their native clergy are 30, and Romo-Syrians 332.

* The Abbé also tells us, that in Mysore, the internal arrangements of a Hindu, are under the control of his spiritual guide, who in cases of grave delin- quency, such as eating a porcupine, a snake, or an onion, has the power of expelling him from his caste.
* The Dutch appear to have been generally kind to their allies, when fugi- tives; thus in May 1777 the Rajah of Cranganore, was granted Rupees 50 a Month : the eldest Payencharry Nair, Rupees 30 : and from September 1777 the Prince of Cartamana, Rupees 10 a Month : the same to be continued, so long as they remained faithful.
* After Vishnu, in the form of Rama had killed Ravana, the wife of the latter came and prayed for a blessing, and he promised she should never be a widow. Then discovering to whom he had made this promise, he directed Hunaman to constantly heap up wood on Ravana's funeral pyre, which he con- tinues until the present time. Until the fire goes out, Ravana's body cannot be considered to be consumed, and until it is, his wife is not a widow. Should a Hindu be asked for a proof of the truth of this, he directs one to place a finger in either ear, when the noise of the fire still burning may be distinctly heard.

* It must be a subject of regret, to the well wishers of a Christianity of peace and love, to perceive the virulent declamations, of some Protestants, against those in authority, whom they denounce as passively, if not actively hostile to religion. The chapter on the Dutch, shows how Christianity flourishes under hot house cultivation : and the present lamentable paucity of Protestants, in the Cochin and Travancore States, the subsequent result of such a plan.

* At this period, the Romish Church acknowledged the seven sacraments, of baptism, confirmation, the eucharist, penitence, extreme unction, holy orders, and matrimony; the Syrians are said to have had only three, viz., bap- tism, the eucharist, and holy orders, and to have repudiated the idea of pur- gatory.

* The term Nestoians, is derived from Nestorius, who was consecrated Bishop of Constantinople, A.D. 429. He acknowledged the duality of persons in the Saviour of the world, and that a worshipper might unite in his adora- tions, the persons and the natures, which he separated in his Creed.
† During the seventh century, the Moplahs oppressed the Syrians, so they retired from the Northern portions of Malabar, to the Cochin territory, choos- ing a head man or king. Subsequently owing to adoption, a Hindu prince ruled over them in temporal matters : when the Portuguese arrived, he was named Beliarte, Rajah of Diamper, and was bound to protect them against Hindus or Mahomedans, but being bankrupt, he applied to the Europeans for pecuniary assistance. The Christians were divided into two parts, the Northern or Samorin's party, denominated Panircurra, which included all

* In 1762, the Rajah of Cochin, mortgaged the Coosipully lands, lying north of Vypeen, to the Dutch, for Rs. 15,000, in order to meet the expenses of the small army, which in accordance with his agreement with the Rajah of Travancore, had been equipped for the field against the Samorin. If these lands were not redeemed by the Rajah before September, the Dutch were to collect the revenues.

Ten years later, the hieroglyphies on the cross, were tranlated by a Brahman, into a short history of the Saint and his Converts, with an account of his death, and the erection of the stone, by certain Kings in commemoration of him. Before the year 1561, its being in a perspiration was considered a good omen, but since that period it has been a bad one.

* The four Roman Catholic castes, are at the present time, divided in the following manner. The first, the Arawutnarleecar, (or the community of sixty- four,) is said to have consisted originally of converted Brahmans and Nairs. The second, the Moonootecar, (or three hundred,) are the Latins, or Topasses, so named from wearing hats, and believed to have mostly sprung from domes- tic slaves. The third, the Unuttccar, (the five hundred,) are considered to have originally sprung from Mneuas, or converted fishermen, and other low caste people, they generally call themselves Moplahs. The fourth, the Erunoortecar (seven hundred,) are the descendants of the sail slaves. The Catanars or Priests are generally taken from the second, or fourth of these communities or castes.

* Paoli says, "had they been originally Indians, why should they make use "of Chaldaic expressions, and not much rather words peculiar to the Malabar "and Sanscrit langauges? it is therefore not improbable, that a considerable "number of Christians, went from Persia and Chaldea to India, and united "themselves to the small body of the original Indian Christians, whose ances- "tors were formerly converted to the Christian faith, by the Apostle Thomas."

* About this time the Roman Catholics of Calicut, were thrown into a state of great excitement, by a play which was acted by the Syrians. The principal characters represented by St. Thomas, and St. Peter, with St. Syriae as umpire. St. Thomas commenced by detailing an account of St. Peter and himself, showing how they were both disciples of our Lord, and that now his territories were infringed upon : that he claimed the East, the West was St. Peter's, and there he ought to remain. St. Peter replied, that he claimed all the world. The umpire St. Syriae decided in favour of St. Thomas, because the Christians of India, depended not upon St. Peter, but on the Patriarch of Babylon, whilst the Portuguese prelate he denounced as a faithless heretic, and decided that the decrees extorted by force at Diamper, were manifestly null and void.
* Dutch Government Records of Cochin M.S.S.
* Most of the Dutch Government records of Cochin, numbering many hundred volumes, are still extant in the Cutcherry. Some are effaced by time, and more mutilated by insects. Owing to valuable translations kindly made, by C. D'Albedyhll, Esq., and the use of those effected by a former Collector, (Oliphant,) much of the text of this Chapter had been compiled from Official sources, hitherto unpublished. Each Dutch Governor left a Memorial for his successor, which detailed the history of his administration, &c., likewise a Diary was kept, in which all important, and many unimportant events were registered. There was also the "letter received" book, and the "letter despatched" book. The "Secret resolution record" the translation book of all letters from the neighbour- ing Rajahs, the Judicial, and Orphanage records, the Trade books, and many others.
† The treaties between the Dutch and the Rajah of Cochin, were dated, March 22nd, 1663 : February 25th, 1664 : February 23rd, 1674 : May 21st, 1678 : May 9th, 1681 : April 6th, 1698 : February 14th, 1772 : October 11th 1785. But there were also agreements in writing, and other verbal ones, all considered binding on the Rajah.
* To give an idea of the presents which were exchanged, between the Dutch Governor, and the Rajah of Travancore, the following is inserted. Van Angel- beck wrote to the Rajah, September 30th, 1795, stating that he is transmitting the following things, which he trusts His Highness will accept as a proof of the Company's friendship. Two flasks of Cinnamon oil : two flasks of Clove oil : one case of Cloves: one piece of red Velvet: four pieces of Satin: one Carboy of rosewater : two reams of gilt edged paper: one pound of red sealing wax : and four bundles of quills.
* This pepper treaty was ever after a source of irritation, and Van Angel- beck alludes to the subject in his memorial to his successor, in 1793. The Rajah never appears to have furnished the quantity he promised, and Com- missioners were continually being sent to Trivandrum to remind him, at last it was only by agreeing to raise the price to Rupees 115 a candy, that they obtained any; in 1790 none was furnished, and a higher price demanded, which Van Angelbeck refused to give. Sometimes Travancore declared the Dutch ought to have none, as they were assisting their enemies: afterwards that they were engaged with the Mysoreans; anyhow, the treaty does not appear, to have brought either credit, or money to the Dutch.

* In olden times, the Cochin Rajah, had the token of unlimited power car- ried before him: consisting of the branch of a cocoanut tree, the lower end of which, was bound with a bandage, leaving the top quite free. Petty Princes, if subject to any higher authority, were obliged to have the branch bound at each end.
* Paterson gives the three first symbols of the Deity as follows: To the Swan, on which Brahma rides, he attributes purity, justice, and truth, it being a pure unspotted fowl, that swimmings amongst the waters of the world, is dis- tinct from, and unsullied by them, however filthy they may be. The Garuda of Vishnu, is the full blaze of day, the dazzling truth. The Bull of Siva, has a virtue in every joint, his three horns are the three Vedas, and his tail ends, where injustice commences.
* These lapidaries constructed more than 400 guns for the Samorin, in whose service they continued, until the year 1506, when they were both murdered as traitors, by 200 Nairs, and Yogees. However, they sold their lives dearly, as they are said to have slain six of their assailant, and wounded forty more, be- fore being finally overpowered.
* The Samorin was induced to join in an alliance with the Portuguese, his old enemies, against the Rajah of Cuneale, as the only effectual means he had of punishing one, who had taken upon himself, the titles of, King of the Mala- bar Moors, and Lord of the Indian seas, and who had also cruelly ill-treated a Nair, and dared to cut off the tail of an elephant!
* The house of a Namboorie is called an Illum, the ground on which it stands is freehold property. That of a Putter, is termed a Muddum; of a Nair, a Veedoo, unless a Dewan, or Judge, should be a Nair, when it is called a Muddum : a Christian's, a Peediya : a Chogan's, a Cotikul : a Churmur's, a Chahla : an European's, a Bungalow.
* Land disposed of, either by the Government of Cochin, or by that of Tra- vancore, had certain conditions or obligations attached to the transfer. Some- times they were rent free, or on a very reduced rate, or tax, on condition that the holder should perform some particular service, such as beating out a cer- tain quantity of paddy in the year, carrying a certain number of loads from one place to another, or supplying a certain quantity of articles, such as milk, oil, flowers, &c., at stated periods.
* On the taking of Cochin, the following silver furniture was delivered up, as the property of this Church: 1 font, 1 plate, 2 bread dishes, 2 waiters, 1 fun- nel, 4 goblets, 68 cyphers and letters, 1 margin and 1 bell for the collecting purse, a small font, and the brass stand of an hour glass, apparently employ- ed for regulating the length of the sermons, but the glass unfortunately is bro- ken : the cyphers appear to have been used, for marking the hymns on a board. Besides these, there were various designations, for as many bags : so that sub- scribers, knew whether their money was given to the Leper-hospital, the or- phanage, the widows, or the poor.

* This may be one reason, why ill governed Native states, are preferred by the inhabitants, to the well ruled British possessions. Natives appear better satisfied if kept in order by force, and bullied into reason, than if treated by kindness, and ruled with forbearance, which is synonymous amongst them, with cowardice, fear, or foolishness. So it is in magisterial matters, he who decides all cases upon their merits, without allowing bribes to sway him, has the epithet of "silly fellow," or "fool," affixed to his name!
* They were however jealous of foreign interference; thus in 1740, when the Moravian United Brethren, attempted to establish a Mission in Ceylon, the Clergy opposed the project so virulently, that the Governor, Van Imhoff, was obliged to order the Missionaries to settle inland, beyond the Dutch limits. At the end of that year, Van Imhoff was promoted to Batavia, and the Mora- vians, in October were expelled to the Island.
* At Chowghaut, the Mucuas dissatisfied at having no religious observances like other people, and feeling the want of them, whilst they are aware that they cannot ascend in the Hindu scale, are rapidly decreasing in numbers, as it has become the custom, for one son in every family to become a Mahomedan Mop- lah. This class are known as the Pooddia Islam, or the "new Mahomedans."
* In the Dutch records it is stated that Cranganore is deemed specially sacred, on account of its having been built whilst Puresu Rama was on earth. At Trichoor it is said the name Kudungaloor is merely a corruption of Kodi (a crore), lingum (the Indian Phallus), oor (country). In the Kodungaloor, or Cranganore pagoda, are numerous figures of the lingum.
* Almeyda commenced the Cannanore Fort in 1505, whilst on his way to Cochin. He left Lorenzo de Brito, with 150 men, and two vessels to defend it.
* As a Medical topography, is incompatible, with the scheme of the present, work, it can only be observed : that it is unfortunately but too true, that "no "town of corresponding importance, possesses in so small a degree, appliances, "for the preservation of the public health, or where sewerage and drainage, "are so little attended to" but these matters, are in no degree under medical control. Readers curious on these subjects, are referred to the first 3 volumes of the Madras Quarterly Journal of Medical Science, for the years 1860 and 1861.

* In the Dutch Records for 1743, it is expressly stated: the Cranganore territory owed obedience to the Dutch Company, and was not under the Ra- jah of Cochin. That they obtained this territory by a treaty of peace made with the Samorin, December 17th, 1717, but they allowed the line of the Cran- ganore Rajahs to continue as their vassals.
† The Rajah of Cochin, in 1792, unsuccessfully laid claim before the Bri- tish Comissioners, to the whole island, called by Europeans, Chetwye (Ma- napuram): which consisted of three small territories, Cranganore to the south, Paponetty or Ayroor in the centre, and Chetwye to the north.
* In 1757, Commandant de Jong, addressed some secret considerations to Ba- tavia. He observes, that the principal object of the Dutch company, in expel- ling the Portuguese from the Western Coast of India, was in order to become the possessors of the pepper-trade, exclusive of every other nation. But the bad faith of the Malabar princes, and the competition of European rivals, caus- ed them much disappointment. Their competitors bought pepper as they required it, always paying the market rate, or a little above it, whilst the Dutch insisted upon the performance of the contracts at a low fixed rate, and that no pepper should be disposed of, until they were served. The contracts mention no fixed rate, but only speak of the market rate, as the rule to be adhered to. The Dutch designated all trade with other parties contraband, and frequently brought Military force to check it, this was expensive, and the Malabar com- mand was almost invariably in debt. In his memorial, he gives his opinion, that monopolies in this article, did not exist before the advent of the Dutch, and were illegal combinations of the rulers, as he hints for defrauding the people. The Portuguese obtained it he remarks, from the Rajahs, but they only acted like brokers, between the owners

* Mr Swaardekroon, a former Governor of Cochin, who was Governor-Gene- ral of Batavia, from 1718 to 1725, procured the coffee plant from Mocha, and after paying a very high price for what was first produced (15 rix dollars, per 125 pounds weight,) he further encouraged its growth by every means in his power. In 1753, 1,200,000 pounds weight were furnished from Cheribon, as much from Jaccatra and the Preanger lands : in 1768, from Jaccatra and the Preanger lands, 4,165,500 pounds weight of this were produced.
* The Hindus assert, that Tippoo's defeat, was a dispensation on him, for his cruelty in the Annimallis. Knowing that the destruction of a female ele- phant, is considered on eof the worst violation of Hindu laws, for the preserva- tion of animal life, he practised it. Female elephants were chained to the ground by their forefeet, and the Sultan then tried, how deeply he could cut with his sword, through the necks of the poor animals. He then ordered Mus- salmen, and lastly even Brahmans, to take their turn, in the amusement. Ganesha was no doubt incensed, and retribution followed.

* It cannot be supposed that increasing the depth of the bar, so as to permit larger vessels to enter the Cochin river, will increase the amount of produce shipped from the port. Any one who has seen the British harbours along the Western Coast, must be persuaded Cochin is far superior to any of the others.
