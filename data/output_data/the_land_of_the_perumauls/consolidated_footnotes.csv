the_land_of_the_perumauls_page_159.jpg,139,"* In 1757, Commandant de Jong, addressed some secret considerations to Ba- tavia. He observes, that the principal object of the Dutch company, in expel- ling the Portuguese from the Western Coast of India, was in order to become the possessors of the pepper-trade, exclusive of every other nation. But the bad faith of the Malabar princes, and the competition of European rivals, caus- ed them much disappointment. Their competitors bought pepper as they required it, always paying the market rate, or a little above it, whilst the Dutch insisted upon the performance of the contracts at a low fixed rate, and that no pepper should be disposed of, until they were served. The contracts mention no fixed rate, but only speak of the market rate, as the rule to be adhered to. The Dutch designated all trade with other parties contraband, and frequently brought Military force to check it, this was expensive, and the Malabar com- mand was almost invariably in debt. In his memorial, he gives his opinion, that monopolies in this article, did not exist before the advent of the Dutch, and were illegal combinations of the rulers, as he hints for defrauding the people. The Portuguese obtained it he remarks, from the Rajahs, but they only acted like brokers, between the owners (cotd.) of the pepper, and the Portuguese Government. When competition arose, monopolies were by degrees introduced, but such a power does not exist in the laws of Cheruman Permaul, by which the rulers of Malabar are bound, and from which they cannot deviate, without the consent of their subjects. This was a cause, why the Rajahs and Chiefs, feared to prevent smuggling, as they were well aware, of the illegality of the system of monopolies.",4,290

Ten years later, the hieroglyphies on the cross, were tranlated by a Brahman, into a short history of the Saint and his Converts, with an account of his death, and the erection of the stone, by certain Kings in commemoration of him.

St. Peter replied, that he claimed all the world. The umpire St. Syriae decided in favour of St. Thomas, because the Christians of India, depended not upon St. Peter, but on the Patriarch of Babylon, whilst the Portuguese prelate he denounced as a faithless heretic, and decided that the decrees extorted by force at Diamper, were manifestly null and void.",6,145

The Hindu tabernacle, is properly speaking borne by priests, (although it is now mostly taken on wheels forming a car) whilst that of the Jews is directed to be carried by Levites : or should none such be present, by the highest in rank, amongst the members of the congregation.

The most (cotd.) extraordinary legends concerning this people are extant, and for the verifica- tion of many of them, the shade of Cheraman Permaul is invoked, even hundreds of years after he had paid the debt of nature, A.D. 378.

It appcars that the origi- nal date, or rather that given on the copper plates by the translator, is one year subsequent to Cheraman Permaul's death, whereas the text of the grant, states it to have been made in the 36th year of his reign, or the year before his demise, viz., A. D. 377. If the translation is referred to, it will be seen that the grant was made in the 36th year of his reign, but written in A.D. 379. The Syrian plates are identical with those of the Jews, which has given rise to the idea, that both, or at all events one of them, must be spurious, but quite an opposite construction may be placed on this similarity.

But it is nothing of the sort, it is the best test that could be adduced to the contrary, (admitting them to be pure Europeans, which they are not.) The pure White Jews have never been able to continue their race without the aid of immigrants from other places, and before this question was ever mooted, Governor Moen’s remarked, that the White Jews were continued, owing to constant admixture with new blood. So it is now, none of upwards of three generations, born in the country, of pure white blood on both father’s and mother’s side, can be detected. The plains of India are unsuited for permanent colonization by the white races, if we are to draw conclusions from bygone facts, or reason by analogy with what is daily perceptible around.",1,170

VII) how the Hindus venerate the Vedas, and what care they take, to prevent their even being seen by the lower castes : how carefully the Jews preserve their Pentateuch, and the honour in which they hold it. It has been discussed, whether the Bible ought or ought not, to be in the hands of all indiscriminately. The Roman Catholics consider that the former course would end in its not being respected, whilst on the other hand many Protestants think it would be advisable to use it as a class book in the schools. It may well be remarked, with what respect the Koran is treated by the Mahomedans. In a public discussion in Mysore, regarding the respective merits of the Christian and Mahomedan faith, the Missionary produced his bible, ""but a difficulty arose about the Koran, for the Jury insist- ""ed on its being produced.
